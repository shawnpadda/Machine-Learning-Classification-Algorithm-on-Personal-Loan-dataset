# # Predicting the Acceptance or Rejection of Personal Loans using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms. 

# # Introduction 

# The dataset pertains to a fictitious bank that has a growing customer base. The bank desires to expand its loan business and subsequently earn interest on the loans. In particular, the management seeks to target its liability customers (depositors) to purchase their personal loans. The bank ran a campaign last year, and the liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. To reduce the cost of the campaign, the bank's marketing department wants to target their liability customers with a minimal budget cost. The bank's marketing department is interested in knowing how a machine learning algorithm or model can better predict a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

# # Objective 

# The objective of this project is to predict whether customers will purchase the personal loan or not, and which machine learning algorithm will provide the best accuracy.

# # Motivation

# My motivation for pursuing this project is to learn how machine learning algorithms can be useful in financial institutions. 

# # Data source

# The classification evaluation report and the confusion matrix demonstrated the logistic model's remarkable performance. The classification report included four key evaluation metrics: precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy, some of which indicated that the overall outcome was impressive. The confusion matrix also Indicates the number of false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), total positives (TP), and total negatives (TN). False-negative, or FN (also known as Type-2 error rate), refers to customers who obtained a personal loan, but the prediction showed they didn't purchase a personal loan. On the other hand, FP (also known as Type-1 error rate) denotes customers who did not purchase personal loans but were predicted to do so. As a result, it's referred to as misclassification. The confusion matrix revealed the true representation of actual versus predicted values.

Whereas 1 indicates the customers who purchased the personal loan. The scatter plot depicts the type of personal loan, income,  as well as the customers' average monthly credit card usage.

# # Conclusion

# After a thorough investigation, feature engineering,Â and exploration of the dataset variables, some of the most prominent supervised machine learning algorithms were deployed in this project. The objective of utilizing these advanced algorithms was to find the optimum algorithm for assisting the retail marketing department in identifying potential customers who are more likely to buy the loan. As a result, after testing the most sophisticated algorithms, I discovered that the random forest algorithm is the best fit for this dataset. The bank should apply the random forest algorithm, which will assist the bank's retail marketing department in cutting campaign costs. Last but not least, the random forest accurately predicted whether potential consumers would accept or refuse a personal loan in future campaigns.
